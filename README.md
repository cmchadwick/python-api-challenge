# python-api-challenge

In this challenge, I used APIs in order to gather and analyze data on weather for various cities around the world. In WeatherPy.ipynb, you can find a breakdown of the climate, comparing the northern and southern hemisphere to find trends. In VacationPy.ipynb, you can find an analysis of different hotels that fit a criteria based on weather factors.
